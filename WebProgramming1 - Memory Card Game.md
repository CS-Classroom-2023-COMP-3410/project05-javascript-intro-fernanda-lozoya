we're creating a customizable keyboard trainer where the rules are as follows:
-using css, html,java(if needed)
-display random text strings for users to type,track speed and accuracy
-highlight errors in real time and calculate words per minute(WPM) and accuracy
-allow difficulty to be adjusted(base difficulty on string length, special characters,etc)
-provide results summary and restart option

## RESPONSE 24

The customizable keyboard trainer has been implemented! It includes:

1.  **Typing Practice**: Users can practice typing randomized text strings.
2.  **Real-Time Feedback**: Highlights errors and updates WPM and accuracy as the user types.
3.  **Adjustable Difficulty**: Supports different levels of text difficulty (easy, normal, hard).
4.  **Results Summary**: Displays WPM and accuracy at the end of the session.
5.  **Restart Option**: Allows users to reset and start a new typing session.

You can now test this tool. Let me know if you'd like to add more features or make adjustments!

## PROMPT 25

have it switch text string as soon as first string is typed in completion. Then combine accuracy results. Keep it going and keep track so that as soon as a minute has gone by it can accurately display the WPM

## RESPONSE 25

The typing trainer has been updated! Now, the following changes are implemented:

1.  **Continuous Typing**: A new text string loads immediately after the previous one is completed.
2.  **Cumulative Stats**: Words per minute (WPM) and accuracy are tracked across all text strings.
3.  **Time Limit**: Automatically calculates and finalizes WPM and accuracy after one minute.
4.  **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time accuracy and error tracking.

Feel free to test it and let me know if further refinements are needed!

## PROMPT 26

add in the functionality of pressing "return"(on mac) in order to move on to a different string of text. That way you dont lose time clicking start. this  is more practical and allows for more accurate measure of WPM

## RESPONSE 26

The keyboard trainer has been updated to start the practice as soon as the user presses "Return" (or "Enter"). This eliminates the need to click the start button, enabling a smoother transition and more accurate WPM measurement. Let me know if you'd like to tweak anything further!

## PROMPT 27

dont allow for return to do line skips. it messes with accuracy and also, it wont change strings when I'm done typing the first one

## RESPONSE 27

I've updated the keyboard trainer so pressing "Return" (or "Enter") no longer causes line skips. Additionally, when "Return" is pressed after completing the current string, it moves on to the next one seamlessly without interrupting the flow. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!

## PROMPT 28

Great, just one more tweak:
-when i make mistakes i delete and fix, but accuracy goes back to 100% is i do that. I want it to remember that I made a mistake
-however, do not have it be thrown off by the mistake and count the rest of the characters as a mistake. One or two  mistakes per sentence should not have the accuracy thrown off to negative values

## RESPONSE 28

The trainer now tracks mistakes persistently, even if you delete and retype to correct them. It ensures that making one or two mistakes doesn't throw off the rest of the accuracy calculation. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

## PROMPT 29

great, now forget lets go back to the interactive to-do list we made earlier in this thread

## RESPONSE 29

The interactive to-do list has been restored! It includes:
